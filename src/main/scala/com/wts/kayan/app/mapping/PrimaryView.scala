 * query execution plans based on data size and distribution.

   * SQL query string to join orders and clients data with a left join operation.
   * This query enriches order data by adding client details from a client view.
   *
   * The query leverages Spark SQL's broadcast join hint to optimize the join operation by broadcasting
   * the smaller dataset (clients) across the cluster. This reduces data shuffling and improves query performance.

   * @return A SQL query string that can be executed in Spark SQL to retrieve enriched order data with client details.

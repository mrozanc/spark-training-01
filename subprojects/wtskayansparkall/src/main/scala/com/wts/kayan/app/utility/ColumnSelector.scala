/**
 * Object to manage the selection of columns for various tables within the Spark application.
 * This allows for centralized control over which columns are retrieved for specific datasets,

 *
 * The object provides a method to retrieve an array of column names based on the table name,
 * simplifying the process of querying data with Spark SQL or DataFrame operations.
